This project expands the classic Chrome Dino game by incorporating Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles in Java. New features include flying bird obstacles, shield
power-ups, coin collection, and persistent high score tracking.
The game is built using core OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and
polymorphism. Each element (player, obstacles, power-ups) is modeled as a distinct object,
ensuring modularity and scalability.
In addition to replicating the original gameplay, this version adds dynamic challenges,
real-time game loop handling, collision detection, event-driven logic, and basic file I/O. It
demonstrates how Java and OOP can be applied in an interactive game setting.
